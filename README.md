# romanNumeralConverter
A project from freeCodeCamp for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects Developer Certification

This algorithm brute forces the conversion of a decimal number to a roman numeral.  The actual coding was completed on freeCodeCamp's website as part of the project, so this is just the completed code that passed all the tests set as part of the project.
